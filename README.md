# TripleTen-Sprint-17-Final-Project-
This was the final project for the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp. In this project, I was tasked with building a model that could accurately predict the churn rate for the company Interconnect. My goal was to create a binary classification model that could predict churn rate with an AUC-ROC score of 0.88 or higher.
